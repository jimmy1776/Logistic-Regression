In this project found in the Advanced Data Analytics Course by Google, I was tasked with building a logistic regression model for binary classification. The goal of said model was to find the root causes of why employees were leaving a fictional company at such high rates and build a model which would predict if an employee was at risk of leaving the company so that preventive measures could be taken.
Before building the model, basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) was performed, graphs were plotted to visualize the relationships between variables and ensure the assumptions for logistic regression modeling were met.
